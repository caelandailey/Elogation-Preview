#### What for?
My person project [Frender](https://github.com/caelandailey/FrenderApp) needs an elegant way to view multiple events. 
Elogation preview provides an easy way to look through different events and provide details with a smooth transition. 

#### What's different?
- While scrolling the image size of the event changes. 
- Provides smooth transitioning to event details

#### What's next
- Implement search function
- Load JSON data from Firebase
- Design: Where to put menu bar, and if to use tab bar?
